# HackerSM64 Configurator

A Godot Project that streamlines the [HackerSM64](https://github.com/HackerN64/HackerSM64) repo configuration process.


## Features
 - Configure any HackerSM64 repository in one place (Theoretically supports custom config files too)
 - Intuitive UI controls
 - Remembers your repo folder
 - Hover over a control to view a description of its functionality

## TODOs
 - Read enum includes to make certain entries into dropdowns
 - Add special cases to entries such as Internal ROM Name
 - Make descriptions work fully (and fit the screen lol)
 - Figure out scrollbar layouts (They work but are displayed nowhere near correctly)
 - Make the app look pretty and themed and whatnot (hi godot devs ðŸ™‚)
   - This also entails making the UI compliant to some legibility standard because the current UI is hard to follow horizontally
